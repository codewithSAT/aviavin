    description:
      'A quadplane is a hybrid fixed-wing and multicopter aircraft. It looks like a conventional plane with additional rotors that enable it to take off and land vertically. The simplest quadplane has 4 additional rotors configured in the same way as a quadcopter – hence the name quadplane. The rotors are either affixed to the wings and/or body in addition to the quadplane’s forward flight propellers, or they rotate to transition the quadplane from hover to forward flight mode. Regardless of its rotor configuration, a quadplane always takes off and lands on its belly.',
